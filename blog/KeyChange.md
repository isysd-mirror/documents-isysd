# Notice of Email & PGP Key Change

I am consolidating and organizing all communication into one public and one private channel. From today forward, please contact me at [public@iramiller.com](public@iramiller.com), using key `20F44729`. I created one other address with the `iramiller.com` domain for my private use, but this will use the same `20F44729` key.

 - public@iramiller.com
 - [20F44729](keydir/isysd.asc)

### Deprecated Addresses

The following domains and corresponding email addresses are being phased out. Emails going to these addresses will be forwarded.

 - deginner.com
 - gitguild.com

Additionally, I am no longer using the following addresses, though the domains remain active. Emails going here may be forwarded, and will be answered slowly.

 - [coinapult.com](https://coinapult.com)
 - [founderinstitute.net](https://fi.co)
 - [gmail.com](https://gmail.com)

### Deprecated Keys

Finally, the following PGP keys are deprecated. I will never use any of them again to sign or encrypt communication. If you receive a message signed or encrypted with one of these keys, treat it as if you did not know it was from me.

 - 9DAD2C03
 - 6CD2F41F
 - 638DA742
 - B5D3D208
 - 4E4FBA61
 - 5C3586F6

### Signatures

The only valid key for the next ~3 years, or until I post another Notice of Change, will be `20F44729`. You can find the full ascii-armored key [here](keydir/isysd.asc). The source code for this notice ([KeyChange.md](src/KeyChange.md)) was signed with [20F44729](signatures/KeyChange.md.20F44729.asc), as well as [5C3586F6](signatures/KeyChange.md.5C3586F6.asc), and [6CD2F41F](signatures/KeyChange.md.6CD2F41F.asc).
