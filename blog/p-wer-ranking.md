# P/WER Ranking

## Method for effort-weighted prioritization of projects

Long term project planning can be a challenge, particularly with limited resources. All complex operations require mangers to weigh various priorities and efforts to accomplish long term goals. Sometimes numerical analysis is helpful in enumerating and comparing the various concerns.

P/WER or Priority / Work Effort Remaining is a metric that indicates the long-term importance of working on a project. This tool can help project managers visualize priorities and navigate complex roadmaps.

**P (Priority)**

The priority rank from 1 (most priority) to 10 (least priority). This is just like any ranking. Your #1 priority gets a 1. If you have more than 10 projects, treat each number like a tier.

**WER (Work Effort Remaining)**

The estimated amount of work remaining on an absolute scale of 1 to 10. On this scale, 1 means no work remains, and 10 means the hardest task that would be considered. The reason 1 is used to represent no work instead of 0 is to avoid dividing by zero, which would give an imaginary result. Think of it as a 0-9 ranking then add 1 to all of your WER scores at the end, if that helps.

**P/WER (Priority / Work Effort Remaining)**

A metric that indicates the long-term importance of working on a project. The lower P/WER a project has, the more important it is to work on it.

*0.1-0.5*

A P/WER score of 0.1-0.5 indicates a high priority task. These have a relatively high importance and require significant work. It is extremely important to find time to work on these tasks.

0.5-1

A P/WER score of 0.5-1 indicates a priority task. These tasks are relatively important for how much work remains. It could be that not much work remains and the task is of medium importance, or it is an important task with a medium amount of work remaining.

1-2

A P/WER score of 1-2 indicates a low-priority task. These tasks are a lot of work relative to their importance. Maybe theyâ€™re sort of important but extremely hard, or not very important and medium hard. Either way, save these for a rainy day.

2-10

A P/WER score above 2 indicates a super low-priority task. Are you even going to do this? Better file it away and forget about it for a while.

###Examples

**Important and Hard Project**

Priority - 1

WER - 10

P/WER - 0.1

**Important and Medium Difficulty Project**

Priority - 2

WER - 5

P/WER - 0.4

**Medium Importance and Medium Difficulty Project**

Priority - 5

WER - 5

P/WER -1

**Low Importance and Medium Difficulty Project**

Priority - 10

WER - 5

P/WER - 2

Once each task has been P/WER scored, it may be helpful to rank and sort them in ascending order. This is not necessarily the order you need to do things in, but it is the order of importance to your organization in the long term.

May all your decisions be easy, until next time.
